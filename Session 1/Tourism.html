        <h3>About Turkey</h3>
        <p>Ayasofya (Hagia Sophia) is known as the eighth wonder of the world. This wondrous building was initially
            built in the 6th century under Byzantine emperor Justinian I, formerly a cathedral, and later became a
            mosque with the Ottoman conquest.</p>
        <p>Today, Ayasofya is now a museum located in Istanbul, listed as one of the top tourist attractions without any
            doubt. When entering the building, you’ll see incredible mosaics and other spectacular forms of art and
            architecture. Also significant because it unites the world’s religions, and many visitors see Ayasofya as a
            symbol of peace, harmony, and tolerance.Ephesus is an ancient city built in the 10th century BCE. Its ruins
            still exist, reflecting centuries of inhabitants. Tourists can spot classical Greek architecture to the
            invasion of the Roman Empire and the spread of Christianity.Today, you can find Ephesus on Turkey’s western
            shore, 80 kilometers south of Izmir, where there are many well-preserved ruins along the route. Some of the
            most famous include the Temple of Hadrian and the Temple of Artemis.
